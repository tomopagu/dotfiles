# トモ　。Files

Currently just my terminal setup but will aim to be a complete install script from new machine to get setup quickly with what I'm comfortable with

# Install

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the cloned repository in your terminal (likely hyperterm!)
3. Symlink the hyperterm file and overwrite the default hyperterm with the following `ln -fsv .hyperterm.js ~`.
4. Symlink the config.fish file with `ln -fsv config.fish ~/.config/fish`.
5. Wait for it to download and then full reload hyperterm to finish the installation.
